## References 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, 
and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have 
helped you, AI tools you've used, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

️**Title**: `FitPro Your Ultimate Workout and Goal Tracker.`

**Purpose**: `Fitpro is a python application design to help user track log workout
 track progress and set fitness goal`

**Source Assignment(s)**: `My project would be based on T02, exploring turtles for graphic representaion
HW07 and T08. `

**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
![Don't leave me in your README!](image/crc.png "Image of CRC card as an example. Upload your CRC card(s) in place of this one. ")

️**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: I'm working alone so it's just one branch "nimely_J"
    
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. 🙃

Reflect on what you’ve done so far. How’s it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    I feel a little worried as I just now understood how GUI works. Generaly, I feel anxious, there are some parts of this assignment that 
    I don't fully understand yet. Also, I feel a little behind, I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't understand some parts of what I'm doing. 
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

**Completion Percentage**: `71- 100%`

**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```  ** I feel moderately confident about completing the project. Most of the  functionality, such as the User and Workout classes and the ability to save and log user details, has been implemented
    I'm trying to make the app look better by adjusting the colors, fonts, and padding to make it more visually appealing. I'm also working on using the turtle library to create a progress chart, so users can see their workout progress in a fun and interactive way.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

###User Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 

After hitting the "Run" button in PyCharm, the FitPro application will open in a new window. Follow these steps to use the program:

Enter User Information:
In the "Name," "Age," and "Height (cm)" fields, input your details and click the "Login" button. This will save your profile information, which will be used to track your workouts.

Log a Workout:
In the workout section, enter the type of workout (e.g., "Running"), duration in minutes, and calories burned. Click the "Log Workout" button to save the workout to your profile.

View Progress:
Click the "View Progress" button to see a summary of your total workouts, total duration, and calories burned. A popup will display your progress so far.

Repeat as Needed:
You can continue adding workouts and viewing progress as often as you like. When done, simply close the window to exit the program.



###Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?

```
I picked this project because I am passionate about fitness and thought it would be fun to combine it with technology. 
I wanted to build something simple but useful that helps people track their workouts and see their progress. 
Plus, it was a great way to practice what I’ve learned about coding and designing apps. The final project is pretty close to what I had in mind when I started.  
I also added things like error messages and input validation, which weren’t part of my original plan. While I couldn’t add everything I wanted, I’m proud of what I created. 
This project taught me a lot about programming, especially about connecting the user interface with the app's logic.
 I also learned how important it is to test your code as you go to catch mistakes early. 
Debugging was challenging, but it helped me get better at problem-solving and thinking through how different parts of the program interact.  If I could do it again, 
I’d spend more time testing smaller pieces of the app earlier to avoid some of the issues I ran into later. I’d also plan better to add better features. Overall,
I’m happy with how it turned out and what I learned along the way.```
